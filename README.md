## Mission The Road Warrior

![](/assets/logo_road_warrior.png)

> A new startup wants to build the next generation global online trip management dashboard to allow travelers to see all of their existing reservations organized by trip either online (web) or through their mobile device. Build a sustainable architecture for same.


### Challenge

- [Problem statement](./doc/problem.md)
- [Additional Clarifications](./doc/clarification.md)
- [Glossary](./doc/glossary.md)

## Approach

We follow actor/action model to begin with. We identify the actors and actions they need to perform. We, then, create components which will enable actors to perform specific actions. Next, we find interactions among actors. This provides us high level view of actors components required in the system, their relation to stakeholders and their (inter)dependency.

We create use case diagrams to visualize the functional requirements to assists us making design choices and understanding the system on more granular level.

Now we understand the desired system behavior better so we qualify the requirements to identify architecture characteristics. These characteristics help us identify the most suitable architecture style for the solution.

We use C4 model technique to design the architecture, starting with most abstract view of the system and going further in details in each step.

We use ADR approach to make a informed decision for all important architecture decisions.

### Actor/Action

## Architecture

> This exercise is primarily focused on defining the architectural style and structure of the system. While we acknowledge the critical importance of **security**, **access management**, **high availability**, **encryption**, **GDPR** and **backup** in the overall system design, these aspects are not within the scope of this proposal. Our intention is to first establish the architectural foundation, and subsequently, these implicit aspects will be addressed in a separate, dedicated effort.

### Overview

- [Deploying system in cloud or on premise](/doc/adr/0008-deploying-system-in-cloud-or-on-premise.md)

### C4 Modeling

> The C4 model is an "abstraction-first" approach to diagramming software architecture, based upon abstractions that reflect how software architects and developers think about and build software.

* [Container](doc/c4/container.md)
* Components
